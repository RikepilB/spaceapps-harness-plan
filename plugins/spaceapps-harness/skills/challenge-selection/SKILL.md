# Choosing the challenge

Run this the day the challenge statements drop, not the morning of the hackathon.

## Step 1 - establish the team's real capability

Ask directly, and write the answers down:

- Who can ship a deployed web interface unaided?
- Who can do data engineering on scientific formats (netCDF, HDF5, GeoTIFF)?
- Who can train and honestly evaluate a model?
- Who can design, illustrate, animate or compose?
- Who can present on camera, in English, without reading?
- Who has domain background in anything the challenges touch?

Missing capabilities are constraints, not problems to solve during the weekend. A team
with no designer should not pick Art & Technology.

## Step 2 - score every challenge

Six dimensions, 1-5 each. Show the full matrix; do not shortlist before scoring.

| Dimension | 1 | 5 |
|---|---|---|
| Data readiness | needs approval, or nothing verified resolves | CSV or open API, downloadable in ten minutes |
| Demo legibility | output is a number in a terminal | output is a picture a stranger reads in 20 seconds |
| Scope fit | needs a capability the team lacks | v1 reachable by hour 12 |
| Saturation (crowding) | thin field, few teams | every team will do this |
| Award surface | fits one award category | plausibly fits three or more |
| Differentiator | this team brings nothing special | this team brings something almost nobody else has |

**Hard gates.** A 1 or 2 on Data readiness or Scope fit eliminates the challenge
regardless of total. These are not preferences; they are the two failure modes that end
weekends.

**Ranking among survivors:** `(demo legibility x 2) + award surface + differentiator - saturation`

Saturation is scored as **crowding**: 5 means everyone will pick it, 1 means a thin field.
It is the only dimension where high is bad, which is why the formula subtracts it. Check
the direction before you trust a total.

Demo legibility is doubled because Presentation is a fifth of the rubric and because it
gates the judge's ability to score the other four at all.

## Step 3 - run the counter-argument

For the leading pick, write the strongest case against it, then answer it. If you
cannot answer it, the runner-up wins. Do not skip this - a scoring matrix built by the
person who already has a favourite will confirm the favourite.

## Step 4 - write the kill criteria

Before starting, name what you would have to learn in the first three hours to abandon
this challenge. Typically: the data does not contain the variable you assumed, the
download is too large, or the labels do not mean what the documentation implied.
Checking the kill criteria at hour 3 is cheap; discovering them at hour 20 is fatal.

## Notes on specific challenge archetypes

- **"Create Your Own Challenge"** is scoped for beginners and youth. It also removes
  Relevance as an anchor, since there is no published objective to be responsive to.
  Avoid it if you are competing.
- **Advanced-only challenges** have thinner fields but need genuine capability.
- **Storytelling, education and art challenges** convert unusually well because
  Presentation is a fifth of the score and most technical teams under-invest there.
- **Popular challenges are not penalized.** In 2025 three of ten winners came from
  Commercializing LEO; in 2023 two different teams won separate awards on the same
  challenge.

## Output

The matrix, the top three with a paragraph each, one recommendation stated plainly with
the reason the runner-up loses, and the kill criteria.

Do not return "it depends on your preference". Pick one and defend it.
